# Configuration

Without a package configuration file, the same defaults apply as for `sillbeam: {}`. The source boundary is `%kernel.project_dir%/src`; its namespace is determined from Composer PSR-4. Relative paths refer to the application directory. Ambiguous PSR-4 mappings require an explicit namespace.

```yaml
sillbeam:
    discovery:
        root: '%kernel.project_dir%/src'
        namespace: 'App\'
        excludes: ['Generated/**', '**/Tests/**']
        # When specified, each list replaces the default for that kind.
        modules:
            - path: src/Domain
              namespace: 'App\Domain\'
              excludes: ['Legacy/**']
            - path: packages/Accounting/src
              namespace: 'Accounting\'
        projects:
            - path: src/Surface
              namespace: 'App\Surface\'
    integrations:
        controllers: [Http, '**/Controller']
        entities: [Model, '**/Entity']
        services:
            exclude: ['Model/**', '**/Entity/**', '**/Dto/**', '**/Tests/**', '**/Fixtures/**', '**/Migrations/**']
    modules:
        legacy: { enabled: false }
        'project:shop:old-reports': { enabled: false }
    projects:
        shop: { hosts: [shop.example.com, www.example.com] }
        admin: { hosts: [admin.example.com] }
    doctrine:
        enabled: null
```

Multiple configuration files are merged according to Symfony rules: root, exclusion and integration lists are appended; an explicit entry replaces the corresponding default. An empty list removes the default but does not delete entries from earlier configuration files.

Without specified lists, Module roots are `src/Module` and Project roots are `src/Project`. An empty list removes the corresponding default. Explicit roots must exist and Composer autoloading must be able to load their namespaces. Identical paths with conflicting namespaces are errors. The source root remains monitored as well; descriptors outside permitted boundaries are reported.

Patterns use `/`, `*` (one segment), `**` (recursive) and `?`. Global exclusions are relative to the source root or absolute; local exclusions are relative to their root. Exclusions apply to discovery and automatic service, route and entity imports. Controller/entity patterns select directories relative to the descriptor area. Defaults: `Controller`, `**/Controller` and `Entity`, `**/Entity`.

Service imports exclude `Entity/`, `Dto/`, `Tests/`, `Fixtures/` and `Migrations/` by default, directly under the Module/Project descriptor and at any nesting depth. These exclusions apply only to automatic service registration; discovery, routing and Doctrine retain their own configuration. An explicit `integrations.services.exclude` list replaces these defaults, so retain the development-directory patterns when customizing it. An empty list opts into importing all directories. If entities are placed under `Model`, add its service exclusion. Native Symfony attributes and explicit `services.yaml` remain available.

Doctrine: `null` activates automatically when DoctrineBundle is registered; `true` requires it and fails without the bundle; `false` disables Sillbeam mappings. The shorthand `doctrine: false` is allowed. Only active modules are mapped automatically; direct Project entities are also mapped. Manual native mappings are preserved, even when they intentionally include excluded areas again.

Activation options can use `%env(bool:...)%`. They are resolved at build time. Rebuild the container cache after changing build environment variables.

Former Foundation keys such as `api`, `security`, `user` or `management` are invalid; see [Migration](../migration/modular-monolith.md).

Project hosts are exact, trimmed hostnames without scheme, port, path or wildcard; case is normalized. IDs match `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`. Unknown Module/Project configuration addresses are build errors.

## Configuration prepended by other bundles

Symfony runs bundle extension `prepend()` methods in registration order before loading extensions. Without active Doctrine integration, Sillbeam applies the final configuration when loading its extension, including configuration prepended by a later bundle.

When Doctrine integration is enabled, Sillbeam prepares its mappings during `prepend()`. Register any bundle that prepends Sillbeam configuration **before `SillbeamCoreBundle`**, or set the options directly in application configuration. If a later bundle changes Sillbeam configuration while Doctrine integration is enabled or becomes enabled, the build fails with an explicit configuration-order error rather than using conflicting architecture and mapping states. Prepended configuration that leaves the processed settings and discovery options unchanged is allowed.
